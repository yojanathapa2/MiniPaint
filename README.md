A professional digital art studio built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a beautiful interface, powerful drawing tools, and an algorithm visualizer.

## üé® Features

### Drawing Tools
- **Brush** - Smooth freehand drawing
- **Pen** - Precise thin lines
- **Marker** - Bold, semi-transparent strokes
- **Eraser** - Remove unwanted marks
- **Line** - Draw straight lines (DDA/Bresenham/Wu)
- **Rectangle** - Perfect rectangles
- **Circle** - Perfect circles (Midpoint algorithm)
- **Triangle** - Geometric triangles
- **Star** - 5-pointed stars
- **Heart** - Heart shapes

### Algorithm Visualizer
- **Algorithms**:
  - DDA Line: Digital Differential Analyzer
  - Bresenham Line: Integer-based line drawing
  - Wu Line: Anti-aliased line drawing
  - Midpoint Circle: Efficient circle drawing
  - Flood Fill: 4-connected area filling (BFS)
  - B√©zier Curve: Smooth quadratic curves
- **Interactive Grid**: 60x40 pixels with adjustable points
- **Animation**: Visualize algorithm steps with 50-500ms speed control
- **B√©zier Curve Note**: Smaller font size for control point buttons to prevent text wrapping

### Professional Features
- **Adjustable brush size** (1-100px)
- **Rich color palette** (24+ colors)
